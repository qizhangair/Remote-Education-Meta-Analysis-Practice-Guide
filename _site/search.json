    "text": "Project Overview 2d\nAlthough remote learning models have existed for decades, their relevance surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted widespread school closures and shifted millions of students into online learning environments. This disruption highlighted the urgent need to understand which forms of remote instructional approaches are effective‚Äîand for whom.\nDespite the rapid adoption of remote learning tools, education leaders continue to face a lack of clear, evidence-based guidance on the effectiveness of math and science programs. Existing reviews have largely overlooked these subject areas and rarely explore how program effectiveness varies by student characteristics, program features, or contextual factors.\nThis meta-analysis addresses these gaps by synthesizing findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remote learning interventions in PreK‚Äì12 math and science education. The goal is to generate actionable insights into the effectiveness of these interventions and identify the conditions under which they are most successful.\nHow to Use This Site\nNavigate to the Find What Works page to explore key findings from our meta-analysis. There, you can browse studies and interventions that demonstrate positive effects on student achievement.\nVisit the Resources page to access our project brief, learn more about the team and research through our project website, and explore open-source data and materials shared on the Open Science Framework (OSF)."
