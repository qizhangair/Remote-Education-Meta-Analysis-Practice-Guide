    "text": "Our review of remote learning programs in math and science highlights three key features that consistently contribute to effectiveness: structured instructional design, consistent engagement, and personalized feedback. Programs that combined direct instruction with collaborative learning were especially impactful, suggesting that a balance of structured guidance and peer interaction may be optimal for remote STEM education. Additionally, consistent student interaction was associated with better outcomes, though our findings indicate that effectiveness peaks with regular‚Äîbut not necessarily daily‚Äîengagement. Finally, programs that included feedback and personalized support showed stronger results, underscoring the value of tailoring instruction to student needs in remote settings where real-time teacher contact may be limited.\nThis page highlights these effective strategies, organized by key instructional features. Scroll down or use the menu on the left to explore example programs that incorporate direct instruction, collaborative learning, consistent student interaction, and personalized feedback."

    "text": "Project Overview 2d\nAlthough remote learning models have existed for decades, their relevance surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted widespread school closures and shifted millions of students into online learning environments. This disruption highlighted the urgent need to understand which forms of remote instructional approaches are effective‚Äîand for whom.\nDespite the rapid adoption of remote learning tools, education leaders continue to face a lack of clear, evidence-based guidance on the effectiveness of math and science programs. Existing reviews have largely overlooked these subject areas and rarely explore how program effectiveness varies by student characteristics, program features, or contextual factors.\nThis meta-analysis addresses these gaps by synthesizing findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remote learning interventions in PreK‚Äì12 math and science education. The goal is to generate actionable insights into the effectiveness of these interventions and identify the conditions under which they are most successful.\nHow to Use This Site\nNavigate to the Find What Works page to explore key findings from our meta-analysis. There, you can browse studies and interventions that demonstrate positive effects on student achievement.\nVisit the Resources page to access our project brief, learn more about the team and research through our project website, and explore open-source data and materials shared on the Open Science Framework (OSF)."

American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 1(1), 52‚Äì74. https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.1.1.52\nIntervention: I CAN Learn¬Æ (ICL) is a computer-based mathematics curriculum designed to support student learning in Algebra and Pre-Algebra through interactive lessons aligned with NCTM standards. The program includes over 600 lessons presented in a sequenced, mastery-based format that combines video-based instruction, guided practice, and immediate feedback. Students proceed at their own pace, and the system automatically adjusts to their performance, allowing for differentiated instruction.\nImplementation: The intervention was implemented as part of regular school instruction in middle and high schools. Students used the computer-based curriculum in dedicated computer labs for one full class period per day, typically replacing their traditional math class. The implementation spanned an entire academic year, during which students progressed through sequenced lessons covering Pre-Algebra and Algebra I content.\nSample: 1,588 middle and high school students across three urban school districts in the U.S.\nOutcome: NWEA Algebra Achievement Test\nEffect Size: +0.36 SD\n\n\n\n\nAssessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS)\n\n\nStudy: Wilder, S., & Berry, L.
