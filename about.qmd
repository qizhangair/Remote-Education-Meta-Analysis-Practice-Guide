**Project Overview 2d**

Although remote learning models have existed for decades, their relevance surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted widespread school closures and shifted millions of students into online learning environments. This disruption highlighted the urgent need to understand which forms of remote instructional approaches are effective—and for whom.

Despite the rapid adoption of remote learning tools, education leaders continue to face a lack of clear, evidence-based guidance on the effectiveness of math and science programs. Existing reviews have largely overlooked these subject areas and rarely explore how program effectiveness varies by student characteristics, program features, or contextual factors.

This meta-analysis addresses these gaps by synthesizing findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remote learning interventions in PreK–12 math and science education. The goal is to generate actionable insights into the effectiveness of these interventions and identify the conditions under which they are most successful.
